UNIT 3 PRACTICE - Task 1: Calculate Remaining Time
=============================================================================
Concepts: Basic function, parameters, return, conditional logic

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Complete the function below where it says # TODO
2. Run this file to test your solution
3. All 4 tests should pass before moving to Task 2

def calculate_remaining(total_seconds, played_seconds):
    """
    Calculate remaining play time for a song.
    
    Takes the total length of a song and how much has been played,
    then returns how many seconds are left. If the played time is
    greater than the total, return 0 (not a negative number).
    
    Args:
        total_seconds: Total length of the song in seconds (int)
        played_seconds: How many seconds have been played (int)
    
    Returns:
        int: Remaining seconds, minimum of 0
    
    Examples:
        >>> calculate_remaining(180, 60)
        120
        >>> calculate_remaining(200, 250)
        0
        >>> calculate_remaining(300, 300)
        0
